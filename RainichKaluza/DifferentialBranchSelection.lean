# Differential selection of the relative-sign branches

On the generic complementary plane, the two pointwise scalar covector
candidates have the form `alpha + beta` and `alpha - beta`, where `alpha` and
`beta` are the two spectral components.  Exterior differentiation is linear.
Consequently both candidates can be closed only when the two spectral
components are separately closed.

The theorem is stated for an arbitrary real-linear map `d`; it therefore
applies to the exterior derivative on one-forms in any setting where that map
has been constructed.  It does not assert that either branch is closed.
