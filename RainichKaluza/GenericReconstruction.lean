# Generic eigenbasis reconstruction

This file formalizes the scalar algebra that appears after diagonalizing the
Ricci endomorphism on the proposed generic branch. It is not yet a theorem
that every Lorentzian Ricci endomorphism admits the required real eigenbasis.

If the non-protected eigenvalues are `a` and `b`, their sum is the Ricci trace.
The diagonal entries of a solution to

`R V + V R - tr(R) V = R² - q² I`

are forced to be the quantities below whenever `a ≠ b`. The off-diagonal
`a,b` entry is resonant because `a + b = tr(R)` and is subsequently fixed by
the rank-one condition.
