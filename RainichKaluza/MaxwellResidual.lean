# The reconstructed Maxwell residual

Given a Ricci-like endomorphism `R` and an accepted rank-one scalar candidate
`V`, define the residual `S=R-V`.  This file proves that, once the scalar
square law is imposed, the Sylvester reconstruction equation is *equivalent*
to the central algebraic Maxwell--Rainich identity `S²=q²I`.

This reaches the algebraic entrance to Phase III.  It does not yet construct a
Maxwell two-form square root, impose the energy condition, or solve the
differential complexion equations.
