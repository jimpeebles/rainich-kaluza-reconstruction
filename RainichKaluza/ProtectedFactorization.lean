# Characteristic factorization from a protected opposite root pair

The earlier coefficient development encoded the proposed quadratic
factorization and deduced its two protected roots.  This file proves the
converse needed by the geometric argument: a monic quartic with nonzero roots
`+q` and `-q` necessarily contains the factor `x²-q²`, with the complementary
quadratic fixed by its first two characteristic coefficients.
