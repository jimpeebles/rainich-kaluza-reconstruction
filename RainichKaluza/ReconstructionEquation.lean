# Coordinate-free reconstruction equation

This file derives the Sylvester-type equation used by the eigenbasis analysis.
The proof is valid in any associative real algebra, so matrices and linear
endomorphisms are special cases. The geometric work still has to establish the
premises from the convention-fixed EMD equations.

/-- **Exact noncommutative algebra theorem.** If `R = S + V`, the Maxwell part
squares to a scalar multiple of the identity, and the rank-one scalar part
squares to its trace times itself, then `V` satisfies the reconstruction
equation used throughout the project. -/

/-- **Centralizer invariance.** An involution commuting with `R` sends every
solution of the reconstruction equation to another solution by conjugation.
Thus uniqueness can hold only modulo the involutive centralizer of the Ricci
endomorphism unless additional geometric data break that symmetry. -/
